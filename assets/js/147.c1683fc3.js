apache/incubator-doris:build-env-1.3.1\n\nStep3: Download Doris source\nNow you should in docker environment, and you can download Doris source package.\n(If you have downloaded source and it is not in image, you can map its path to image in Step2.)\n$ wget https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/incubator/doris/0.9/0.9.0-rc01/apache-doris-0.9.0.rc01-incubating-src.tar.gz\n\nStep4: Build
